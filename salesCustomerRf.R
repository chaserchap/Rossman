## Original attempt had created second model with logCustomers and
## both models with logCompetitionDistance and logSales
## also had integers Month and Year, all other variables remained.
## Removed days the stores were closed. Score ~.20045
##
## Second attempt had regular Customers on second model, and regular
## CompetitionDistance in both, otherwise same as original.
## Messed this one up, Month was labeled Week in the test set.
## Score .14117 MSE 0.01675013
##
## Third attempt fixed second attempt
## MSE = 0.01674159

## Fourth attempt, removed month int added week int.
## MSE = 0.008316332 Score .12050

## Fifth: week int, logCustomers
## MSE = 0.008325868
